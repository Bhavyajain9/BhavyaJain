						<p>A Business Hotel is an establishment where the main client segment stems reason for travel is
							business, Jems & jewellery in this case.<br />
							As Jaipur is one of the largest exporters of Gems & Jewellery all over the world, a private
							developer is looking to establish a compact business hotel on the site at it park road,
							Sitapura, Jaipur. The site gives various opportunities in terms of being an important urban
							node as well as in close proximity to the business spine (Tonk road) and airport. The idea
							behind the proposed business hotel will be that it'll be catering to only a specific
							category of business zone, i.e., the gems and jewellery sector.

						<p>Travel, Commute, Business, Education and Economy, all of this has come to a pause due to the
							current pandemic. Conversely, due to the upsurge, the public mobility space playing a vital
							role in today's situation, is inevitable by human activity and has lead to uncontrollable
							mobility at every square mile which has given rise to increase in crowded spaces and making
							them hotspots for transmission of diseases and hence caged people inside their homes.
							<br />
							Transformation of such spaces and change in idea of public mobility is the need of the hour,
							in pursuit of livable cities, towns and villages starting with the rudimentary i.e. mobility
							spaces.
							<br />
							This project is one of the possible answers to an alternative way of thinking to socialize
							in high density areas.

						<p>Health refers to physical, mental, and social well-being; wellness aims to enhance

							HWC are the cornerstone of urban health services- a first port of call to a qualified doctor
							of the public sector in urban areas for the sick and those who directly report or referred
							for curative, preventive and primitive health care. <br />
							The services envisaged at the HWC level will include early identification, basic management,
							counselling, ensuring treatment, adherence, follow up care, ensuing continuity of care by
							appropriate referrals, optimal home and community follow up and health promotion and
							prevention for the expanded range of services. Along with the hospital, a yoga and gym
							centre with the doctor’s residence is also to be proposed.

						<p>A mixed-use residential apartment project at neighbourhood level in urban context.<br />
							The mixed-use building not only sustainably utilizes resources and precious space, but also
							provides city inhabitants with neighbourhoods that integrate work, home, shopping,
							transportation, and even green spaces and aims to combine two or more uses into one
							structure. Whatever the combination, it brings together several uses within either one

							work, you can entertain ... it's all about, ‘How many things can we do without having to get

						<p>The given project is a farmhouse, located in Surana village, 60 kms from Jaipur. The
							farmhouse is for a furniture manufacturer, who want to spend weekends there with his

							buyers stay here, both Indian and international clients.<br />
							The idea for the landscape is of a weekend home that can cater to small and large groups,
							keeping in mind the people of all age groups and different interests. Considering the very
							potential of open spaces, semi open, amalgamation of open and closed spaces, the site has
							been given with the motive to integrate landscape spaces which blends with the architecture
							of the space.

							of homestays, Farmstays are blossoming across the country. Offering its guest unique
							experiences, it’s one of the best ways to enjoy nature at its best away from the hustle and

							education. Away from the privileges of the city the stays are with all modern facilities and
							amenities. Usually run by the family the owners offer domestic food and extend a warm
							hospitality.<br />
							The site being in Thekkady, Kerala has a warm & humid climate and very fewer seasonal &
							diurnal variations and requires an elongated planform and a sloped roof in order to be
